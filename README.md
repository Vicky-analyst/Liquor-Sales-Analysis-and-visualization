# Liquor Sales Analysis and vizualization


## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data to understand revenue distribution across different counties and products. The focus is on identifying the highest and lowest-performing counties, comparing their contributions to total sales, and examining the factors driving these differences. Population density, urbanization, and the presence of entertainment venues play a crucial role in sales performance, with urbanized counties contributing significantly more revenue.

Additionally, the project explores product-level sales trends, identifying the best-selling products and those with seasonal demand fluctuations. While some products maintain steady sales throughout the year, others experience sharp increases during specific periods, such as holidays. Understanding these patterns provides valuable insights into consumer purchasing behavior and market trends.

By leveraging data analysis and visualization, this project offers a comprehensive view of how sales are distributed across locations and product categories, helping businesses and stakeholders make informed decisions.
